# Simple-Page

(This repository is build by me and some other sources from the web.)
This was build as an school project that had some potetial to be published on github, so i think a back story is needed for this project.

The assement was that needed to build a website in a team (i did mostly of the coding) and we came up with a idea to make a kinda a porn review site but i want to change the project when it's done to make a simpel usable content uploading site that doesn't need that much horse power to drive it. So hopefuly you can also support me with building this repository and make this a good working project.

(I will make multiple versions so there will be some bugs in some versions and other will be more stable.)


It is build in php and also uses mysql and a mail server.

(will come later when there is a working beta build.)
